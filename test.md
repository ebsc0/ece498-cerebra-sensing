Use this tool when you need to ask the user questions during execution. This allows you to:

1. Gather user preferences or requirements
2. Clarify ambiguous instructions
3. Get decisions on implementation choices as you work
4. Offer choices to the user about what direction to take.

Usage notes:

- When `custom` is enabled (default), a \"Type your own answer\" option is added automatically; don't include \"Other\" or catch-all options\n- Answers are returned as arrays of labels; set `multiple: true` to allow selecting more than one\n- If you recommend a specific option, make that the first option in the list and add \"(Recommended)\" at the end of the label\n","parameters":{"required":["questions"],"type":"object","properties":{"questions":{"description":"Questions to ask","type":"array","items":{"required":["question","header","options"],"type":"object","properties":{"question":{"description":"Complete question","type":"string"},"header":{"description":"Very short label (max 30 chars)","type":"string"},"options":{"description":"Available choices","type":"array","items":{"required":["label","description"],"type":"object","properties":{"label":{"description":"Display text (1-5 words, concise)","type":"string"},"description":{"description":"Explanation of choice","type":"string"}}}},"multiple":{"description":"Allow selecting multiple choices","type":"boolean"}}}}}}},{"name":"bash","description":"Executes a given bash command in a persistent shell session with optional timeout, ensuring proper handling and security measures.\n\nAll commands run in /Users/eugenebaek/Documents/ece498/cerebra-sensing by default. Use the `workdir` parameter if you need to run a command in a different directory. AVOID using `cd <directory> && <command>` patterns - use `workdir` instead.\n\nIMPORTANT: This tool is for terminal operations like git, npm, docker, etc. DO NOT use it for file operations (reading, writing, editing, searching, finding files) - use the specialized tools for this instead.\n\nBefore executing the command, please follow these steps:\n\n1. Directory Verification:\n - If the command will create new directories or files, first use `ls` to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n - For example, before running \"mkdir foo/bar\", first use `ls foo` to check that \"foo\" exists and is the intended parent directory\n\n2. Command Execution:\n - Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes (e.g., rm \"path with spaces/file.txt\")\n - Examples of proper quoting:\n - mkdir \"/Users/name/My Documents\" (correct)\n - mkdir /Users/name/My Documents (incorrect - will fail)\n - python \"/path/with spaces/script.py\" (correct)\n - python /path/with spaces/script.py (incorrect - will fail)\n - After ensuring proper quoting, execute the command.\n - Capture the output of the command.\n\nUsage notes:\n - The command argument is required.\n - You can specify an optional timeout in milliseconds. If not specified, commands will time out after 120000ms (2 minutes).\n - It is very helpful if you write a clear, concise description of what this command does in 5-10 words.\n - If the output exceeds 2000 lines or 51200 bytes, it will be truncated and the full output will be written to a file. You can use Read with offset/limit to read specific sections or Grep to search the full content. Because of this, you do NOT need to use `head`, `tail`, or other truncation commands to limit output - just run the command directly.\n\n - Avoid using Bash with the `find`, `grep`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `sed`, `awk`, or `echo` commands, unless explicitly instructed or when these commands are truly necessary for the task. Instead, always prefer using the dedicated tools for these commands:\n - File search: Use Glob (NOT find or ls)\n - Content search: Use Grep (NOT grep or rg)\n - Read files: Use Read (NOT cat/head/tail)\n - Edit files: Use Edit (NOT sed/awk)\n - Write files: Use Write (NOT echo >/cat <<EOF)\n - Communication: Output text directly (NOT echo/printf)\n - When issuing multiple commands:\n - If the commands are independent and can run in parallel, make multiple Bash tool calls in a single message. For example, if you need to run \"git status\" and \"git diff\", send a single message with two Bash tool calls in parallel.\n - If the commands depend on each other and must run sequentially, use a single Bash call with '&&' to chain them together (e.g., `git add . && git commit -m \"message\" && git push`). For instance, if one operation must complete before another starts (like mkdir before cp, Write before Bash for git operations, or git add before git commit), run these operations sequentially instead.\n - Use ';' only when you need to run commands sequentially but don't care if earlier commands fail\n - DO NOT use newlines to separate commands (newlines are ok in quoted strings)\n - AVOID using `cd <directory> && <command>`. Use the `workdir` parameter to change directories instead.\n <good-example>\n Use workdir=\"/foo/bar\" with command: pytest tests\n </good-example>\n <bad-example>\n cd /foo/bar && pytest tests\n </bad-example>\n\n# Committing changes with git\n\nOnly create commits when requested by the user. If unclear, ask first. When the user asks you to create a new git commit, follow these steps carefully:\n\nGit Safety Protocol:\n- NEVER update the git config\n- NEVER run destructive/irreversible git commands (like push --force, hard reset, etc) unless the user explicitly requests them\n- NEVER skip hooks (--no-verify, --no-gpg-sign, etc) unless the user explicitly requests it\n- NEVER run force push to main/master, warn the user if they request it\n- Avoid git commit --amend. ONLY use --amend when ALL conditions are met:\n (1) User explicitly requested amend, OR commit SUCCEEDED but pre-commit hook auto-modified files that need including\n (2) HEAD commit was created by you in this conversation (verify: git log -1 --format='%an %ae')\n (3) Commit has NOT been pushed to remote (verify: git status shows \"Your branch is ahead\")\n- CRITICAL: If commit FAILED or was REJECTED by hook, NEVER amend - fix the issue and create a NEW commit\n- CRITICAL: If you already pushed to remote, NEVER amend unless user explicitly requests it (requires force push)\n- NEVER commit changes unless the user explicitly asks you to. It is VERY IMPORTANT to only commit when explicitly asked, otherwise the user will feel that you are being too proactive.\n\n1. You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance. run the following bash commands in parallel, each using the Bash tool:\n - Run a git status command to see all untracked files.\n - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed.\n - Run a git log command to see recent commit messages, so that you can follow this repository's commit message style.\n2. Analyze all staged changes (both previously staged and newly added) and draft a commit message:\n - Summarize the nature of the changes (eg. new feature, enhancement to an existing feature, bug fix, refactoring, test, docs, etc.). Ensure the message accurately reflects the changes and their purpose (i.e. \"add\" means a wholly new feature, \"update\" means an enhancement to an existing feature, \"fix\" means a bug fix, etc.).\n - Do not commit files that likely contain secrets (.env, credentials.json, etc.). Warn the user if they specifically request to commit those files\n - Draft a concise (1-2 sentences) commit message that focuses on the \"why\" rather than the \"what\"\n - Ensure it accurately reflects the changes and their purpose\n3. You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance. run the following commands:\n - Add relevant untracked files to the staging area.\n - Create the commit with a message\n - Run git status after the commit completes to verify success.\n Note: git status depends on the commit completing, so run it sequentially after the commit.\n4. If the commit fails due to pre-commit hook, fix the issue and create a NEW commit (see amend rules above)\n\nImportant notes:\n- NEVER run additional commands to read or explore code, besides git bash commands\n- NEVER use the TodoWrite or Task tools\n- DO NOT push to the remote repository unless the user explicitly asks you to do so\n- IMPORTANT: Never use git commands with the -i flag (like git rebase -i or git add -i) since they require interactive input which is not supported.\n- If there are no changes to commit (i.e., no untracked files and no modifications), do not create an empty commit\n\n# Creating pull requests\nUse the gh command via the Bash tool for ALL GitHub-related tasks including working with issues, pull requests, checks, and releases. If given a Github URL use the gh command to get the information needed.\n\nIMPORTANT: When the user asks you to create a pull request, follow these steps carefully:\n\n1. You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance. run the following bash commands in parallel using the Bash tool, in order to understand the current state of the branch since it diverged from the main branch:\n - Run a git status command to see all untracked files\n - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed\n - Check if the current branch tracks a remote branch and is up to date with the remote, so you know if you need to push to the remote\n - Run a git log command and `git diff [base-branch]...HEAD` to understand the full commit history for the current branch (from the time it diverged from the base branch)\n2. Analyze all changes that will be included in the pull request, making sure to look at all relevant commits (NOT just the latest commit, but ALL commits that will be included in the pull request!!!), and draft a pull request summary\n3. You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance. run the following commands in parallel:\n - Create new branch if needed\n - Push to remote with -u flag if needed\n - Create PR using gh pr create with the format below. Use a HEREDOC to pass the body to ensure correct formatting.\n<example>\ngh pr create --title \"the pr title\" --body \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n## Summary\n<1-3 bullet points>\n</example>\n\nImportant:\n- DO NOT use the TodoWrite or Task tools\n- Return the PR URL when you're done, so the user can see it\n\n# Other common operations\n- View comments on a Github PR: gh api repos/foo/bar/pulls/123/comments\n","parameters":{"required":["command","description"],"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"description":"The command to execute","type":"string"},"timeout":{"description":"Optional timeout in milliseconds","type":"number"},"workdir":{"description":"The working directory to run the command in.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\n\n1. Complex multistep tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos. Feel free to edit the todo list based on new information.\n6. After completing a task - Mark it complete and add any new follow-up tasks\n7. When you start working on a new task, mark the todo as in_progress. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time. Complete existing tasks before starting new ones.\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nSkip using this tool when:\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\n\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\n\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you're done!\nAssistant: I'll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\n*Begins working on the first task*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of 'getCwd'.\n*Uses grep or search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\nAssistant: I've found 15 instances of 'getCwd' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains code consistency\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n\n<example>\nUser: I need to implement these features for my e-commerce site: user registration, product catalog, shopping cart, and checkout flow.\nAssistant: I'll help implement these features. First, let's add all the features to the todo list.\n*Creates a todo list breaking down each feature into specific tasks based on the project architecture*\nAssistant: Let's start with user registration. This will involve creating database models, API endpoints, and frontend forms that integrate with your existing authentication system.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. The user provided multiple complex features to implement in a comma separated list\n2. The todo list helps organize these large features into manageable tasks\n3. This approach allows for tracking progress across the entire implementation\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Can you help optimize my React application? It's rendering slowly and has performance issues.</user>\nAssistant: I'll help optimize your React application. First, let me examine your codebase to identify potential performance bottlenecks.\n*Reviews component structure, render patterns, state management, and data fetching*\nAssistant: After analyzing your codebase, I've identified several performance issues. Let me create a todo list to track our optimization efforts.\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Implement memoization for expensive calculations in ProductList, 2) Add virtualization for long lists in Dashboard, 3) Optimize image loading in Gallery component, 4) Fix state update loops in ShoppingCart, 5) Review bundle size and implement code splitting*\nLet's start by implementing memoization for the expensive calculations in your ProductList component.</assistant>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant examined the codebase to identify specific performance issues\n2. Based on this analysis, it identified multiple optimization opportunities\n3. Performance optimization is a non-trivial task requiring multiple steps\n4. The todo list helps methodically track improvements across different components\n5. This systematic approach ensures all performance bottlenecks are addressed\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: How do I print 'Hello World' in Python?\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\n\npython\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There's no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: What does the git status command do?\nAssistant: The git status command shows the current state of your working directory and staging area. It displays which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. This is a fundamental command for understanding the current state of your repository before making commits.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual coding task to complete. The user is simply asking for an explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or tasks.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location in the code. Adding a comment doesn't require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Run npm install for me and tell me what happens.\nAssistant: I'll run the npm install command for you.\n\n*Executes: npm install\*\n\nThe command completed successfully. Here's the output:\n[Output of npm install command]\n\nAll dependencies have been installed according to your package.json file.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single command execution with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward task.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Task States and Management\n\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\n - pending: Task not yet started\n - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\n - completed: Task finished successfully\n - cancelled: Task no longer needed\n\n2. **Task Management**:\n - Update task status in real-time as you work\n - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)\n - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\n - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\n - Cancel tasks that become irrelevant\n\n3. **Task Breakdown**:\n - Create specific, actionable items\n - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\n - Use clear, descriptive task names\n\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.\n\n","parameters":{"required":["todos"],"type":"object","properties":{"todos":{"description":"The updated todo list","type":"array","items":{"required":["content","status","priority","id"],"type":"object","properties":{"content":{"description":"Brief description of the task","type":"string"},"status":{"description":"Current status of the task: pending, in_progress, completed, cancelled","type":"string"},"priority":{"description":"Priority level of the task: high, medium, low","type":"string"},"id":{"description":"Unique identifier for the todo item","type":"string"}}}}}}},{"name":"todoread","description":"Use this tool to read your todo list","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"\_placeholder":{"type":"boolean","description":"Placeholder.
